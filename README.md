# PoolGame
## Overview
PoolGame is a work-in-progress game of pool I'm developing and coding for my A-Level Computer Science Programming Project. My writeup for it is attached to this repository.

The premise of PoolGame is pool but for 2+ players so that larger groups can play. 
I'm also planning on implementing other features (e.g. obstacles, multiple cue balls). For more details, see my attached writeup.
