# PoolGame
## Overview
PoolGame is a work-in-progress game of pool I'm developing and coding for my A-Level Computer Science Programming Project. My writeup for it is attached to this repository.

The premise of PoolGame is pool but for 2+ players so that larger groups can play. 
I'm also planning on implementing other features (e.g. obstacles, multiple cue balls), for more details, see my attached writeup.

## Tools, Frameworks, and Libraries used
- **C# (.NET [version])** - The language used for coding the application.
- **Visual Studio 2022** - The integrated development environment used for writing, debugging, and compiling the code.
